- [This code](https://github.com/nonpartisan-redistricting-datahub/election-disag/blob/main/tx_2022/tx_2022_disag.ipynb) was used to disaggregate election results from the precinct level to the Census Block level for the 2022 General Election in Texas, United States
  - Context:
    - Precincts are the lowest level at which votes are reported by county
    - Census Blocks are the lowest level at which the United States Census Bureau reports decenniel population data (most often smaller than precincts)
    - Redistricting plans are drawn using Census blocks, so as such, having data at the Census Block level is important for understanding and planning districts
   
- [This code](https://github.com/nonpartisan-redistricting-datahub/Processing-Requests/blob/wi_ssc_2023/Wisconsin_SSC_Election_Results/er_processing.ipynb) was used to clean and procress election results upon request made to the Redistricting Data Hub for Wisconsin's 2023 State Supreme Court election
